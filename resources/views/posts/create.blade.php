If you want your ICO to be reviewed before others, apply for Priority application. You will be notified via your email when your ICO is published.</p>

                  I am the official representative of this ICO and I give full permission to use all the needed data from all of our resources (website, social networks, white paper, etc.) for the listing on ICObench and the ICObench API. I have read and I agree with ICObench publishing policy presented in the site's FAQ and terms. I am aware that priority application and the payment for it does not mean that my ICO will be automatically accepted. I am also aware that if my ICO is declined I will not get a refund.
